How to Rename DummyProject

First, it is useful to rename the project to avoid problems occurring with 
every project being named projwithvolclass.

Step 1. 

In the Project Explorer, right click on DummyProject and select Team ->
Disconnect. You want to delete the metafile directories.

Step 2.

In the Project Explorer, right click on DummyProject and select rename. 
Enter a name descriptive of the project.

Step 3.

Right click on the project name and select properties. In the dialog select
C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Build Artifact. Change the artifact name from
DummyProject to the same name that you used for the project. Do this for
both Debug and Release versions.

Step 4.

In the Project Explorer under src, rename DummyProject.cpp to the same name
you used for the project.

At this point you should be good to go to edit your new project.
