    '''Compute/load weighted adjacency matrixes of all connected sulcal components.

    Parameters
    ===========

    Adj : list of list of integers/doubles
        adjacency matrix of a connected component

    Dist : list of list of integers
        Dist[i][j] is the shortest distance between vertex i and vertex j
        Dist[i] is the Adj of the i-th connected component

    CID : integer
        a component ID

    Cmpnt : list of integers
        global vertex IDs of all vertexes in a connected sulcal component

    VrtxIdx : integer
        local (inner-componnent) ID of a vertex

    NbrIdx : integer
        local (inner-componnent) ID of a vertex's Nbr

    CurvatureDB : list of doubles
        each element is the curvature value of a vertex

    Pits: list of integers
        Vertex IDs of pits

    Notes
    =======

    Before HBM, this function uses graph power to weigh links between nodes.
    Now (2011-07-17) it uses curvature to weigh.

        The function name lineUp does NOT reveal its purpose. Originally, this function is used to connect
        special vertexes via MST algorithm. But now MST is spanned on both special vertexes and common
        vertexes.

#    Dists = io_file.readLists(DistFile+'.reduced')  # for fast debugging   only
    # End of step 2

    # Step 3: use MST to connect all vertexes in NewVrtxCmpnts and dump into VTK format
    #FundusCmpnts = filterCmpnt(Nodes, VrtxCmpnts) # no need if Nodes are all vertexes on the mesh
    #FundusCmpnts = VrtxCmpnts # if MST will span via all nodes on the mesh

            a list of per-vertex values that will be used to threshold the cortical surface to get sulcal basins, e.g., curvature/convexity
